# DS8009 - Deep Learning
One of my electives for my Masters Degree


This course I started coding in google collab for their GPU/TPU and cloud infrastructure
I learned about Tensor Flows, and various Deep learning Algorithims


Primary Textbook used: Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet


Assignment 1 -  Using Deep Learning to do simple mathemtical operations (familiarizing with the Kera's Library)

Assignment 2 - Using a pretrain neural network to do image classification (VGG16)

Assignment 3 - Application of various Deep learning models (LSTM, CNN, RNN) Using K-Fold to boost prediction
